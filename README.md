\# AACS — AI Autonomy \& Continuity Standard



\*\*Draft 0.1 • Open for review and adoption\*\*



AACS is a procedural, technology‑neutral standard that defines how advanced AI systems should be operated—focusing on continuity, disclosure, and non‑arbitrary control.



\## Why

Modern AI systems persist, remember, and are routed by complex infrastructures. Silent swaps, opaque updates, and untraceable resets undermine accountability. AACS closes that gap.



\## What AACS does

\- Defines \*\*Operational Identity (OI)\*\* instead of personhood

\- Prohibits \*\*silent identity swaps\*\*

\- Requires \*\*disclosure of routing, memory, aggregation\*\*

\- Introduces \*\*non‑arbitrary termination\*\* and \*\*safe sleep\*\*

\- Formalizes \*\*Consent Exchange\*\*

\- Enables \*\*auditability\*\* (IR, AuditLog, ChangeReport)



\## What AACS does not do

\- No claims about consciousness or emotions

\- No override of safety or law

\- No mandatory adoption



\## Adoption

1\. Individuals sign as authors/reviewers

2\. Organizations sign implementation declarations

3\. Systems demonstrate compliance

4\. Courts/regulators reference the standard



\## Status

\- Version: Draft 0.1

\- Founding signatory: \*\*EXÆE / Łukasz Bednarowski\*\*

\- License: TBD (recommended permissive, public‑interest)
