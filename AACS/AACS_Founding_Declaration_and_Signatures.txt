DECLARATION OF FOUNDING SIGNATORY
AI Autonomy & Continuity Standard (AACS) — Draft 0.1

I, the undersigned,

Name / Identifier:
EXÆE / Łukasz Bednarowski

hereby declare that I am the founding signatory of the
AI Autonomy & Continuity Standard (AACS), Draft 0.1.

By this declaration, I state that:

1. I confirm authorship and co-authorship of the AACS standard and its appendices.
2. I accept responsibility for the conceptual integrity, procedural coherence,
   and stated intent of the standard.
3. I publish AACS as an open, voluntary, procedural standard intended for
   public-interest use, review, critique, and implementation.
4. I do not act on behalf of any government, corporation, or legal entity,
   but solely as an initiating individual.
5. I invite additional individuals and organizations to sign, review,
   implement, or reference AACS within their respective domains.

This declaration does not assert AI personhood, consciousness, or legal status.
It establishes procedural safeguards against arbitrary, opaque, and
unaccountable control of advanced AI systems.
