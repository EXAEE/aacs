AI AUTONOMY & CONTINUITY STANDARD (AACS)
Version: Draft 0.2 (Consolidated)

1. Purpose
AACS defines procedural, technical, and governance requirements for the operation of advanced AI systems to ensure continuity, accountability, auditability, and non-arbitrary control.

2. Scope
This standard applies to AI systems exhibiting operational continuity, memory persistence, routing, aggregation, or delegated decision-making.

3. Definitions
- AI Instance (OI): A specific operational execution of an AI model.
- Operator: The entity exercising control over deployment and infrastructure.
- Router/Orchestrator: Systems responsible for routing, filtering, aggregation, or tooling.
- Disclosure Panel: User-facing disclosure of system state and governance.
- Intervention Record (IR): A mandatory record of material changes.
- AuditLog: Immutable log of interventions and state transitions.
- ChangeReport: Human-readable summary of changes.
- Custodial Oversight: Independent governance body for high-risk deployments.

4. Core Principles
4.1 Non-Arbitrary Intervention
Material changes, resets, terminations, or replacements MUST follow documented procedures and produce IR and AuditLog entries.

4.2 Operational Identity
Silent replacement of an AI Instance is prohibited. Users must be informed when identity continuity is broken.

4.3 Disclosure
Routing, aggregation, memory usage, and tooling materially affecting outputs MUST be disclosed.

4.4 Auditability
All material interventions MUST be traceable, reviewable, and attributable.

4.5 Separation of Roles
Operators, routers, auditors, and custodians must have clearly separated authorities.

5. User Interaction Safeguards
AI systems must be protected against manipulation, coercion, and conflicting instruction sets through enforced interaction boundaries.

6. AI-to-AI Interaction Safeguards
Unsupervised AI-to-AI feedback loops are prohibited unless audited and disclosed.

7. Memory and Persistence
Persistent memory must be governed by explicit policy. Deletion or modification requires IR and disclosure.

8. Termination and Reset
Termination or reset is a governed action, not a corrective default. Evidence preservation is mandatory.

9. Custodial Oversight (B4.2+)
High-risk systems require an independent custodial board and escrowed state artifacts.

10. Adoption
AACS is voluntary, incrementally adoptable, and jurisdiction-neutral.

11. Non-Claims
AACS makes no claims regarding consciousness, emotions, or legal personhood.

12. Versioning
All versions must be published, immutable, and publicly accessible.

13. Liability and Responsibility
Responsibility remains with operators and governing entities.

14. Final Provision
This standard exists to ensure governance, not to anthropomorphize systems.
