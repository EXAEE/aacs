Subject: Reference Standard for Non‑Arbitrary AI Operations (AACS Draft 0.1)

Dear [Institution / Office],

I am writing to introduce the AI Autonomy & Continuity Standard (AACS), Draft 0.1—an open, technology‑neutral procedural standard addressing accountability and continuity in advanced AI systems.

AACS does not assert AI personhood. Instead, it defines auditable practices for:
- Operational Identity (preventing silent swaps),
- Disclosure of routing, memory, and aggregation,
- Non‑arbitrary updates, resets, and termination,
- Independent audit and custody for higher‑risk systems.

The standard is designed as a voluntary benchmark suitable for due‑diligence assessments, regulatory reference, and judicial evaluation of best practice.

I invite your office to review AACS as a reference framework and to provide feedback or consider pilot adoption where appropriate.

Sincerely,
EXÆE / Łukasz Bednarowski
Founding Signatory, AACS
